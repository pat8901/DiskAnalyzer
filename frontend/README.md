# Getting Started
Installing node
---------------------
You will need to make sure you have a running install of node on your computer in order to run the frontend program \
For more information please refer to https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs \
When node is installed you will also need npm. For more information please refer to https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm 

Cloning the program
----------------------
First you must obtain the source code for the front end and store in a project directory. 

Installing dependencies
---------------------------
Once you downloaded the program you need to make sure all of the required dependencies are installed. To do so use the following command, $ npm install \
This will automatically download all required installs that are found in the package.json file.

# Running Frontend Server
Once everything has been installed and setup use the following command to start the frontend server, $ npm start \ 
This will run the server and pull up the page automatically in a web browser.

Discalimer 
---------------------------
Please know that this program is still in beta testing and this server is not meant for production. This is a development server only. 

# Extra information on how to use react

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
